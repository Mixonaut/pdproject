## ADMIN PAGE ##

# USER MANAGEMENT #
- Functionality for creating/deleting/modifying accounts

# ENERGY AND DEVICE MONITORING # 
Most of this is somewhat completed front-end wise (needs backend endpoints to function properly)
    - Set energy goals and view progress of goals (if we have time)

# DEVICE MANAGEMENT AND REMOTE CONTROL #
- Manage all user devices remotely
    - turning devices on/off
    - adjusting settings (e.g heating)
    - scheduling devices
- View real time device status for any room

#Â ANOMALY DETECTION #
- Set up detection for unusual device activity (e.g lights left on)
- Set up system to receive alerts (e.g fall alert)
- Create priority levels for alerts (emergency, warning etc)

# DAILY REPORT GENERATION #
- Implemented buttons to export energy information but this needs logic completed (if we can?)
